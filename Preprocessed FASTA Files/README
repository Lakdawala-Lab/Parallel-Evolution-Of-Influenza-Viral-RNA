Preprocessed FASTA files of each genomic segment of human influenza A virus sequences of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were sourced from the Influenza Research Database (http://www.fludb.org/) on June 22, 2018 and July 3, 2018, respectively. Preprocessed FASTA files are provided as an example accompanying the script 'Data Mining and Subsampling.R' found in the Data Mining and Subsampling folder of this repository.
