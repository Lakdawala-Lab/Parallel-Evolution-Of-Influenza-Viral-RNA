README for mining and subsampling of influenza A virus sequences presented in:
"Parallel evolution between genomic segments of seasonal human influenza viruses reveals RNA-RNA relationships".

# RATIONALE

The script provided in this folder details how to clean up FASTA files, removing duplicates and ensuring that only full-length genomes are analyzed. Optionally, this script also describes how to cluster and subsample sequences prior to analysis. Analysis of tree similarity is provided in a separate sub-folder of this repository. Preprocessed FASTA files were sourced from the Influenza Research Database (http://www.fludb.org/).
