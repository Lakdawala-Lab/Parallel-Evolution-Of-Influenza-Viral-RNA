FASTA files of each genomic segment of human influenza A virus sequences of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses were sourced from the Influenza Research Database (http://www.fludb.org/) and subsequently processed as is described in the Data Mining and Subsampling Folder. Processed FASTA files are provided as an example dataset accompanying the script 'Analysis of Tree Similarity.R' found in the Analysis of Tree Similarity folder of this repository.
